# AT\&T: Cloud Architecture, Lakehouse Migration, and Real-Time Analytics

**Role:** MicroStrategy Lead/Architect / Data Analytics Engineer
**Timeline:** November 2020 – March 2022
**Objective:** Resolve challenges in customer service and network performance by migrating legacy MicroStrategy/Teradata analytics to a scalable, **Azure Data Lakehouse** solution using **Databricks** and enabling real-time insights for cross-functional teams .

### 🎯 Problem Statement and Migration Focus

AT\&T faced significant challenges analyzing vast amounts of **customer, network, and financial data** effectively, making it difficult to identify bottlenecks, optimize network capacity, and deliver reliable customer experiences. The project's goal was to transition from traditional data warehousing (MicroStrategy/Teradata) to a modern architecture that supported low-latency and advanced analytics .

### 🛠️ Technical Architecture & Engineering

| System Component | Technologies Used | Implementation Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **New Architecture** | **Azure Databricks**, **Azure Synapse Analytics** | **Architected** and deployed the **Data Lakehouse architecture** on Microsoft Azure for centralized data management and governance . |
| **ETL/Orchestration** | **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**, Python, PySpark | Integrated ADF and Azure Synapse into the Lakehouse. **Engineered PySpark** and SQL scripts to process and integrate diverse data sources (Customer, Transactions, Financial, Network). |
| **Migration** | **MicroStrategy/Teradata to Power BI** | Migrated core reporting logic from legacy MicroStrategy/Teradata environments to high-performance Power BI models and Databricks. |
| **DevOps & MLOps** | **CI/CD Pipelines, Power BI** | **Automated CI/CD pipelines** for Power BI assets, establishing a foundational governance framework conducive to future **ML model deployment** and **MLOps**. |
| **Multi-Cloud** | **AWS S3, Azure** | **Delivered a Proof-of-Concept dossier integrating AWS S3** data with the Azure ecosystem to demonstrate multi-cloud resilience and data exchange capabilities. |
