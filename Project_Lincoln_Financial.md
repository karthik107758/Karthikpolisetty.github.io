# Lincoln Financial Group: ETL Automation, Cloud Migration, and Data Governance

## Role: MicroStrategy and Informatica Consultant / ETL and Report Developer
## Timeline: April 2022 – April 2025
## Focus: Automating data ingestion via Python APIs, leading cloud migration of BI infrastructure, and ensuring data integrity for financial reporting.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

|System Component|Technologies Used|Description|
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
|ETL Automation|Python, Informatica, Oracle|Developed and owned the full lifecycle of the Performance Guarantees initiative, utilizing Python scripts for dynamic API calls.|
|Data Ingestion|Qualtrics API, Informatica Mappings|Engineered highly efficient, API-driven Python scripts to pull Qualtrics survey data and integrate it into Oracle tables via Informatica mappings.|
|BI Architecture|MicroStrategy (On-Prem to Cloud), Power BI|Led the cloud migration of the on-premises MicroStrategy environment.|
|Governance|User Access Management (200+ accounts)|Managed user access and security roles, implementing data validation and reconciliation logic to ensure data integrity between source and target systems.|
|Data Migration|Genesys, Five9|Spearheaded the end-to-end migration of high-volume call center data.|


| Dashboard Name | Problem Statement Solved | Important KPIs Displayed | Business Value Brought |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Voice of Claimant Dashboard** | Measuring customer sentiment and satisfaction metrics regarding the claims process, often using Qualtrics API data integration. | Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) Scores, Claims Resolution Rating, Feedback Volume, Sentiment Score (Positive/Negative). | Enhanced customer experience by providing actionable insights into pain points, leading to targeted process improvements and increased stakeholder satisfaction. |
| **Performance Guarantees Quarterly Report** | Monitoring and validating whether the company is meeting contractual service-level agreements (SLAs) with clients, which often requires user override/reconciliation. | SLA Compliance Rate, Payout Rate, Variance to Guarantee, Manual Override Count (for reconciliation). | Enabled accurate, auditable financial reporting. The ability to use the **Transaction Services Dashboard** for **writeback**  expedited the reconciliation process and ensured compliance with legal/contractual obligations. |
| **Transactions Dashboard (for Product Owners)** | Providing granular visibility into current and pending transactions, along with a mechanism for product owners to manually adjust or reconcile data in the database. | Transaction Volume (Daily/Monthly), Reconciliation Status, Error Rate, Pending Writeback Requests. | **Streamlined operational efficiency** and accountability. Allowed product owners to directly **review and writeback to the database for reconciliation** , reducing reliance on ETL teams for small data adjustments and ensuring data integrity. |
| **Claim Transactions Dashboard** | Tracking the end-to-end flow and status of all insurance claim transactions for monitoring and auditing. | Claim Volume, Average Claim Processing Time, Claims Status (Pending, Approved, Denied), Fraud Flag Rate. | Accelerated **decision-making by 25%**  and ensured faster visibility into the claims pipeline, supporting operational efficiency and audit readiness. |
| **Overall Project Value (ETL/Migration)** | Automating data extraction and ETL flows, and migrating BI infrastructure to the cloud. | Data Processing Time, Infrastructure Costs, Data Accuracy. | **Reduced data processing times by 50%**  via **Python/Informatica automation**, and **reduced infrastructure costs by 30%** by migrating MicroStrategy to the cloud. |


## 📈 Quantified Achievements & Business Value
* 50% Reduction in Data Processing Time: Achieved by automating data extraction and ETL processes using Python scripts and optimized Informatica workflows, significantly improving efficiency.
* 30% Reduction in Infrastructure Costs: Realized by successfully migrating the on-premises MicroStrategy environment to the cloud.
* 25% Increase in Reporting Performance: Direct result of the MicroStrategy cloud migration and subsequent performance tuning efforts.
* 40% Improvement in Data Accuracy: Achieved during the end-to-end migration of call center data from Genesys to Five9, ensuring more reliable operational insights.
* Stakeholder Engagement: Designed and deployed comprehensive dashboards (e.g., Voice of Customer, Quarterly Performance Guarantees) using MicroStrategy and Power BI to enable proactive, data-driven decision-making.

## 🔑 Key Takeaway
This project demonstrates end-to-end data ownership, from custom API integration and Python scripting to managing complex ETL systems (Informatica) and migrating core BI infrastructure to the cloud.
