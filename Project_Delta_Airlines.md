# Delta Air Lines: Cloud Architecture & Enterprise BI Modernization


## Role: Senior Data Engineer / ConsultantTimeline: June 2025 – Present
Objective: Lead the migration of legacy BI platforms (Hyperion, Cognos, SSRS, Tableau) to a governed, performant Microsoft Fabric/Power BI environment, focusing on cost efficiency and real-time operational insights.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
|System Component|Technologies Used|Description|
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
|Data Architecture|Microsoft Fabric, Azure, Teradata, Oracle, Snowflake|Designed the future-state Lakehouse architecture using Fabric, proving viability for large-scale enterprise data ingestion and storage.|
|Migration Strategy|Power BI, Tableau, Hyperion, Cognos, SSRS|Implemented phased migration: transitioned Hyperion reports to Power BI and rebuilt Cognos dashboards in Tableau/Power BI.|
|Optimization|DAX, Power Query, Incremental Refresh|Applied advanced optimization techniques (query folding, parameterization) on Power BI semantic models.|
|Orchestration|Power Automate, Fabric Pipelines|Engineered custom Dynamic Email Subscription workflows for personalized report delivery.|
|Data Sources|Teradata, DB2, SAP HANA, Snowflake, Oracle|Integrated data from high-volume, disparate enterprise platforms into unified reporting layers.|

## 📈 Quantified Achievements & Business Value
* Platform Migration & Efficiency: Spearheaded the migration of legacy reporting platforms (Hyperion, Cognos) to Power BI/Tableau, achieving a 60% reduction in report generation time.

* Fabric Architecture & Cost Savings: Delivered high-impact POCs for Microsoft Fabric, demonstrating a 30% improvement in data refresh efficiency and 50% reduction in storage costs through Lakehouse architecture.

* Performance Optimization: Optimized high-volume Power BI datasets, utilizing incremental refresh techniques to cut data refresh times by 55% and ensure strict SLA compliance.

* Advanced Governance: Implemented robust Row-Level Security (RLS) and workspace governance aligned with complex aviation enterprise data compliance standards.

## 🔑 Key Takeaway
This project demonstrates expertise not only in migrating legacy systems but in architecting the next-generation platform (Microsoft Fabric) and proving its immediate ROI in performance and cost savings.
