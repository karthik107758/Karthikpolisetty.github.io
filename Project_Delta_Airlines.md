| **Charter Spend / Charter Military** | Monitoring costs, revenue, and resource allocation for specialized charter (including military) contracts. | Charter Revenue, Spend per Charter Hour, Contract Fulfillment Rate, Military Contract Profitability. | Optimized resource allocation for private/military contracts and ensured **contract compliance and profitability**. |
| **Component Repair Cost / Shop Order History** | Tracking maintenance spend and efficiency for aircraft component repairs (TechOps focus). | Repair Cost per Component, Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF), Shop Order Completion Time, Component Downtime %. | Optimized maintenance budgets and ensured operational KPIs for **TechOps**. Streamlined repair logistics and reduced component downtime. |
| **Physical Ending Inventory / Sales Order Header** | Providing accurate, timely visibility into warehouse stock and sales order status for planning and fulfillment. | Ending Inventory Value, Inventory Variance, Sales Order Fulfillment Rate, Order Lead Time. | Improved **supply chain visibility** and enabled better demand forecasting and inventory management. |
| **Arrivals and Delays / Cancellations / Denied Boardings** | Monitoring operational performance failures (delays, cancellations) and customer service metrics for regulatory compliance. | On-Time Arrival % (OTP), Delay Minutes/Flight, Cancellation Rate, Denied Boarding Rate, Compensation Costs. | Supported operational KPIs, helping **reduce customer compensation costs** and improve overall passenger experience. |
| **Baggage Savings per Passenger** | Tracking efficiency measures related to baggage handling processes to maximize cost savings and service quality. | Baggage Savings per Passenger, Misrouted Baggage Rate, Handling Cost per Bag. | Minimized operational expenditure related to baggage recovery and maximized efficiency in ground operations, contributing to **passenger satisfaction**. |
| **Summary by POS Country / Travel Expenses POS Country** | Analyzing sales performance and associated travel expenses broken down by the Point of Sale country. | Sales Volume by Country, Revenue per POS Country, Travel Expense Ratio (to Sales). | Supported **Global Sales and Delta Vacations** with tailored analytics , optimizing localized sales strategy and expense management. |
| **Overall Project Value (All Dashboards)** | Migrating legacy platforms and architecting modern reporting solutions. | Adoption Rate, Report Generation Time, Storage Costs. | **Reduced report generation time by 60%** and **delivered Fabric POCs reducing storage costs by 50%**, ensuring the new architecture was adopted rapidly (40% adoption increase).|






## 📈 Quantified Achievements & Business Value
* Platform Migration & Efficiency: Spearheaded the migration of legacy reporting platforms (Hyperion, Cognos) to Power BI/Tableau, achieving a 60% reduction in report generation time.

* Fabric Architecture & Cost Savings: Delivered high-impact POCs for Microsoft Fabric, demonstrating a 30% improvement in data refresh efficiency and 50% reduction in storage costs through Lakehouse architecture.

* Performance Optimization: Optimized high-volume Power BI datasets, utilizing incremental refresh techniques to cut data refresh times by 55% and ensure strict SLA compliance.

* Advanced Governance: Implemented robust Row-Level Security (RLS) and workspace governance aligned with complex aviation enterprise data compliance standards.

## 🔑 Key Takeaway
This project demonstrates expertise not only in migrating legacy systems but in architecting the next-generation platform (Microsoft Fabric) and proving its immediate ROI in performance and cost savings.

This is an excellent way to showcase the true **business value** of your dashboard work in your GitHub portfolio. Recruiters often look beyond the tool names (Power BI, Tableau) to understand the financial and operational impact of your deliverables.
